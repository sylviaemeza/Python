#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):
a = 5
a = 4
a = 3

a = 3.45
a = 5.43
a = 4.32

a = "Sylvia"
a = "Grace"
a = "Sylvia" and "Grace"


a = True
a = False

list
a = {1,2,3,4}
a = {"Sylvia","Grace","Stella"}
a = {True, False, True}
a = {3.2, 4.5,4.8} 

#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

varA = 1
vara = 2

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
var = 4
var = "string"

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:
varTwo = var


#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

b = {a, varA, var}



#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:

string = "Sylvia"

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

b = {a, varA, var}
print(b)

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors

5 = var
