#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
y = "Sylvia " + " Meza "
print(y)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 2 + 2
print(x)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 - 4 
print(x)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 2.55 - 1.5
print(x)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 * 4
print(x)


#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

x = "Sylvia "  * 2
print(x)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4/4
print(x)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 16.5/2.4
print(x)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 6 % 4
print(x)


#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 5 // 4
print(x)


#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 3 ** 2
print(x)


#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error
x = 2 + 2
print(y)
