#1) Get input from the user to the question "What is your favorite color?"
#and store their answer in a variable called favColor.

favColor = input("what is your favorite color?")

#2) Make a variable called question and set it to "What is your name?". Then
#get input from the user to the question and store their answer in a variable
#called name.

name = input("what is your name?")

#3) Get input from the user to the question "What is your age?" and store their
#answer in a variable called age. Convert age from a string variable to a int
#(integer) variable.

age = input("what is your age?")
age = int(age)
age = int(input("what is your age?"))
