#EX) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
from builtins import True, False
one = True
two = False
a = one and two 
print(a)

#1) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
five = True
six = False 
a = five and six
print(a)



#2) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the or operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named b. Print the variable.
one = True
two = False
b = one or two
print(b)


#3) Make one boolean variable. Put the variable after the not. Store this 
#expression in a variable named c. Print the variable.
c = not 3 == 3


#4) Make a logical expression with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
one = True
two = False
b = fix and two
print(b)
