This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a = flowers
b = chocolate
x = (a == b)
print(x)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a = 1
b = 1
x = (a == b)
print(x)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
x = 60
y = 2
z = (x > y)
print(z)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
x = 2
y = 5
z = (x < 5)
print(z)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
s = 17
m = 3
t = (m >= s)
print(t)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
x = 1
y = 6
g = (x <= y)
print(g)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
x = 1
y = 6
g (x <= y)
