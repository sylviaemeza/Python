#1) Create a Variable called grade and set it to an integer. Make an 
#if/elif/else statement. If grade is equal to or above 80, then print "passing".
#Elif grade is lower than 80 and greater than or equal to 60, then print
#"probation". Else, print "failing". 
=if,elif,else
grade = 97
if grade >= 80:
    print("passing")
elif 60 == grade < 80:
    print("probation")    
 else:
     print("failing")   


#2) Make a int variable named a. Now make an if/elif statment, and if a is more
#than/equal too 100 or less than/equal too -100, print "a is a three digit 
#number". Elif a is between 100 and -100, print "a is not a three digit number".
= if, elif
a = 50
if  -100 >= a >= 100:
    print("a is a three digit number")
elif <-100 a  < 100:
    print("a is not a three digit number")


#3)Create a variable called age. Make an if/else statement. If age is older
#than 18, print "You can vote". Else, print "You cannot vote".
= if,else
age = 17
if age > 18:
    print("You can vote")
else:
    print("You cannot vote")   


#4)Make a string variable called answer, and set it to the letter a, b, c, or d.
#Make an if/elif statement. If answer is a, b, or d, print "Wrong". Elif answer
#is c, print "Correct".
= if, elif
answer = b
if answer == a:
    print("Wrong")
elif answer == b:
    print("Correct")


#5)Make two boolean variables. Make an if/elif/else statement. If both booleans 
#are true, print "Both". Elif only one of the booleans is true, print "Only 
#one". Else, print "Neither".
=if, elif, else
a = True
b = False
if a == True == b:
    print("Both")
elif a == True:
    print("Only one")    
else:
    print("Neither")
